# Photography Workflow
This project describes my own photography workflow and presents the status of my work in progress about all photography collections I have.
It also shares all scripts I used in order to achieve it.

## Step 1 - Retrieving images
Each images imported should have : 
- a filename which matches this pattern : **YYYY-MM-DD\_HH:MI:SS\_\<SUFFIX\>**
- some exif tags used for ordering photo collection

You can perform thos action by running this script
```
importPhoto <source> <dest> <suffix> <collection>
```

## Step 2 - Sort images

## Step 3 - Class images

## Step 4 - Improve images

## Step 5 - Backup images
